## Getting Scheme Running Locally

- install the MIT Scheme interpreter from the MIT website
- once installed, enter the REPL to test out code snippets by typing ```mit-scheme```
- I decided I wanted to write scheme outside of the recommended Edwin or Emacs, so I wanted to know how to load definitions from a text file and then just use Atom to edit my code
- to do this, enter the mit-scheme REPL and type ```(load "example.scm")``` to load in your definitions
- note that ```example.scm``` needs to be in your current working directory
- now any procedures you've defined in

## Running Scheme on the Net

- I use repl.it as my scratch pad for testing small snippets of Scheme code
